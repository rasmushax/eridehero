Wisconsin DNR allows Class 1 and Class 3 pedal-assist e-bikes on many State Park System bicycle touring trails with a 15 mph speed limit, but prohibits Class 2 (throttle) e-bikes on those trails. Sidewalk riding is governed by local ordinances; many Wisconsin cities (e.g., Milwaukee) prohibit bicycle/e-bike sidewalk riding.",

During hours of darkness, a white front lamp visible from 500 feet and a red rear reflector or red light visible from 50-500 feet are required. Wisconsin's OWI statute applies to 'motor vehicles,' and e-bikes are explicitly not motor vehicles, so OWI likely does not apply. Persons under 16 may ride as passengers on a Class 3 designed for passengers.",

DC established the Electric Bicycle Incentive Program providing vouchers and rebates for e-bike purchases.
